## Problems

### Climate Change

- Global Warming
	- mass extinction of species
	- extreme weather events (hurricanes, tornados, floods, wildfires, droughts)
	- drinking water shortage
	- water shortage (crucial for heavy industry/power plants)
	- famine
	- migration of people
	- political unrest

### Pollution

- Air
	- PM10
	- PM2.5
	- NOS
	- O3
	
- Water
	- large plastics
	- microplastics
	- chemicals
	
- Soil
	- plastics
	- non-recyclables

- Noise
- Electronics (laptops/iphones/batteries)
- space trash (once a chain reaction of broken satellites becoming space-trash and destroying other satellites start, there is no turning back and unless someone solves it we wont be able to go to space)

### Lifestyle

- Over-consumption & over-production
	- new iPhone every year
	- new clothes collection every 8 weeks
	- 1 year warranty for stuff within EU (A dishwasher should last me a lifetime...)
- Air travel will be more & more popular not less as more people in developing countries such as India or China are getting wealthy enough to be able to afford air travel)
- Ever increasing growth
	- Economy, companies & countries revolve around constant increase and growth of every single metric - production, consumption, taxes, stock prices etc. How is it sustainable?
	- Sustainability is not promoted or enforced. 
	- Neither companies nor consumers are not held accountable for the entire lifcycle of the product. Recycling is scarce.

### Privacy

- Private companies collect/use/sell our data
	- If you are not paying for the product, you are the product.
- Governments spy on us 

### Media and Politics

- Both media and high politics seem to fuel various conflicts, whilst actively deteering out attention from the real problems and preventing us from having a consctructive debate. It's not us vs them. It's us (entire humankind) vs the problems.

## Questions & Potential Answers

### Climate Change questions

1. What are the climate predictions for major Western countries in 10/20/50 years from now?
	- For example will northern Poland in 50 years look like southern France now? 
2. What are the sea level predictions in 10/20/50 years from now?
	- I learned the other day that Greenland icecap melting will cause a sea-level surge in southern hemisphere whilst it's the Antarctic ice Norther hemishpere should be most concerned about.
